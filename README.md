# Rails 8 Project:
## Authentication with Devise & Authorization with Pundit

This project features robust user authentication powered by Devise, a comprehensive and customizable solution for managing user sessions in Rails. Devise handles essential functionalities such as sign-up, login, logout, password recovery, and session management seamlessly.

For fine-grained access control, Pundit is used to implement role-based authorization. It provides a clean and scalable policy-based structure to restrict actions like viewing, editing, or deleting resources based on roles such as Super Admin and Staff User.

Together, Devise and Pundit ensure the application is both securely authenticated and properly authorized, providing a solid foundation for managing user access.

This project is a complete implementation based on the Udemy course:
“Learn Rails 7, ActiveRecord ORM, ActiveJob, Turbo, Stimulus, APIs, Authentication, Authorization – From Scratch Step by Step” by Kameswara Sarma Uppuluri.
